[] A wee puzzle
[] How passing primitives around works
[] How passing data structures (objects) around is different

## Comparing objects

[] Another puzzle
[] A closer look at "sameness"

## Objects with behaviors

[] Not just grouping data-- Also behavior
[] Different ways to attach functions to an object

[] Making objects do useful stuff

## Iterating with objects
